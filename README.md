# .Net-WindowsApp-YouTube-Downloader
This is one of my major project did in .Net(C#) for Windows Platform.

The application will need to have the user to submit a YouTube URL link. With this link, It will present the user with a choice to acquire the video in its various formats and quality.
The application will also provide the ability to prompt the save location and the name of the file. If there are no errors, it will download the video as a file to the computer.

Inorder to Run or test the application download the files and go to:bin/Debug/Assignment-3.exe
